    Alfie Kohn provides a perspective on grades that students everywhere have been looking for. In *The Case Against Grades*, Kohn demonstrates the deep-rooted problems in our 
current system for assessing student success. This perspective excites me for the future of education. I hope that schools can become a place to be excited about learning,
instead of a place of comparisons, fear, and taking the easy way out. In my own education, I have many examples where my motivation has shifted from being excited to learn about
a topic to just skimming by to get a good grade. 
    When I scheduled for my courses of my final semester at Grand Valley, Human Genetics caught my eye. I felt a wave of excitement as I read the description, so I scheduled it. 
This class was set up entirely on LearnSmart, so there was no teacher interaction or feedback. You read the textbook, did an assignment to assess your knowledge, and then get a 
grade once you finish. There was no way to go back and see why you got the answers wrong or learn from your mistakes. This format became **VERY** tedious and a nuisance. 
Since we were allowed to use outside resources, I began just looking up the answers to the homework online to get the good grade. I can honestly say that I did not learn anything 
in this class, because I was just looking for the A at the end of the semester. This was one example of when I took the easy way out to just finish a course with a good grade. 
The class that I was ecstatic for become the class that I dreaded the most due to grades. 
    I am an anxious person in general, so test-taking is not my forte. The stress of getting a decent grade on an exam is overwhelming. The night before every exam, I am 
in panic mode. Even when I feel prepared for the exam, I can't sleep or eat. I am solely focused on cramming for the exam, even when I really don't need to. What if I missed
something in lecture? What if there's an entire section that I forgot about? What if I forget to write my name on the exam? I can clearly see how illogical this all is, but the 
stress of getting good marks on exams eats me alive. I am almost never focused on what the information really means and how I can apply it in my future job or life, instead 
focusing on memorizing facts and acronyms to aid me on the test. 
    I can remember being in elementary school and understanding the importance of getting good grades. I can remember my fourth-grade teacher lecturing about how the middle school
teachers would be so harsh and be very rigorous in their grading. In middle school, I can remember teachers talking about how the high school teachers were monsters and would grade 
harshly. In high school, I remember the teachers saying how college was going to be next to impossible to get good grades. In college, the professors talked about how it was 
important to maintain your grades for your future employer or to get into a master's program. As I moved up through school, I noticed it was fear that these teachers wanted to 
instill in us to maintain good grades. And those teachers did a darn good job of instilling fear, because it feels like the world is collapsing around me when I get any grade
lower than a B+. In one of my upper-level undergraduate Statistics courses, the professor was phenomenal at giving constructive feedback to her students. She would have you scan in 
your work to Blackboard, then she would give you a grade and you had to open your scanned document to see her comments. On one homework assignment, I was really struggling. 
I knew that I would not get a good grade on this homework assignment, but I turned it in anyways. When she finally graded it, I ended up with a D+. I didn't even open the document
to see what I wasn't understanding, because I was so humilated at the fact that I got a poor grade.
